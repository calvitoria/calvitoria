# Hi, I'm Vitória 👋

I’m a Full Stack Software Engineer who loves building things that feel good to use.

I originally studied Architecture & Urbanism, and that background still shapes how I work — I care a lot about structure, aesthetics, and how people experience digital spaces.

I’m curious by nature, always learning, and I get excited about projects that mix tech, creativity, and community.
